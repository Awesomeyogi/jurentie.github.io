## Feature Branch - Single Developer ##

This approach is used by Open Water Foundation when a single developer is primarily
working on any given project. In this case there may be a couple contributors with
write permission to the repository, but one developer is doing most of the work.

When using the feature branch workflow it is easy to keep track of exactly what code
is being added or removed from the overall project. These edits are made in small,
concise, feature branches. This makes it easier to go back in history and find
exactly what code was added to make changes to the project.

All development that takes place is done in feature branches and never in `master`.
This way master will never have any broken code.

#### How it works: ####

A feature branch workflow is intended to keep development from being done directly
on the master branch, so each feature added to the code resides in it's own
separate branch.

1. Following best practices, first create an issue on GitHub that describes what feature is
being added to the code.
![New Issue](images/issue-created.png)

2. Before making the new branch, ensure that you are currently on the master branch
and that `master` is up to date with any recent changes.
```
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
```

3. You can now create a feature branch from the master branch (sometimes referred
to as a "topic" branch), using the issue number and label:  
```
$ git checkout -b 1-update-readme
```
`checkout` switches to a new branch, `-b` creates
the new branch if the given branch name does not already exist.  
The figure below represents a new branch being created off of `master`.

</p>

4. Once in the new feature branch, edit, stage, and commit changes to this branch in
exactly the same manner when editing code on `master`.
```
$ git status
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m "updated README.md"
```

5. After testing the feature to insure no issues,
it is safe to merge `1-update-readme` with `master`. (In a larger team of developers
it would be best to have someone confirm that any changes made, perhaps with [pull
requests](#pull-requests) discussed below.) Switch back to `master`, ensure that
`master` is up to date, and merge `1-update-readme` with `master` branch.
```
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
$ git merge --no-ff 1-update-readme
$ git push
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/merge-no-ff.png">
</p>

By default git will try to merge a branch using **fast-forward** mode. It is best
practice to use **no-fast-forward** witht the following flag `--no-ff`. See [below](#fast-forward) for more information
on **fast-forward** versus **no-fast-forward**.

## Pull Requests - Multiple Developers ##

Pull requests are good to use in larger teams of developers, or in situations where
it is necessary to ensure another person's code is working properly. For example, if several
developers are working on a very important, or a very large project, it is best to
make sure that any changes made to this repository do not break the code. Pull
requests are also a good way for one developer to notify the rest of the team that
they have completed development on a single feature.

Pull requests are an extension of feature branches. Instead of allowing a single
trusted developer to merge their branch without review, they must receive permission
from other members of the team before doing so.

Because every developer on the team will have write permission no fork is needed.
[Forking a repository](#forking-a-repository) is covered below.

> You can open a Pull Request at any point during the development process: when you have little or no code but want to share some screenshots or general ideas, when you're stuck and need help or advice, or when you're ready for someone to review your work. By using GitHub's @mention system in your Pull Request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they're down the hall or ten time zones away.

#### How it works: ####

Begin by following the same steps above for creating a new feature branch to develop
on. See above for more detail.

1. Create a new issue:
![New issue](images/issue-2.png)

2. Start with updated `master`:
```
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
```

3. Create new branch
```
$ git checkout -b 2-add-content-to-readme
```

4. Edit, stage, and commit changes
```
$ git status
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m "updated README.md"
```

Instead of allowing a single developer to merge the edits with `master`, it is
safer to create a pull request. To do this, the feature branch must be pushed to
remote. This differs from the feature branch workflow above.  

5. Push branch to remote
```
$ git push -u origin 2-add-content-to-readme
```
This command pushes `2-add-content-to-readme` to the central repository (origin),
`-u` flag adds it as a remote tracking branch.  
Now that the new branch is pushed to remote it can be seen on GitHub's web interface
such as below.
![new pushed branch](images/new-branch.png)

6. Create a pull request by clicking "Compare & pull request". This will open a
new page with options to add a label and comments to the pull request as well as
assign reviewers to check the code. At the top there is a status bar that shows
whether or not the edits made in this pull request have any merge conflicts
with `master`. After creating the pull request there will be another window that
clearly shows if there are any merge conflicts present, as well as a big green
"Merge pull request" button.
![Pull request created](images/pull-request-created.png)

7. Other developers are able to comment on the pull request and, upon review, any
new commits pushed to the remote branch will appear in the pull request.
![Review](images/review-of-pull-request.png)

8. Once everything looks good, someone with write permission can merge the pull
request by clicking "Merge pull request"

<p align="center">
 <img src="images/merged-pull-request.png">
</p>

By default git will merge the pull request using `--no-ff` (**no-fast-forward**). See
[below](#fast-forward) to learn more about fast forward.

## Forking a Repository - Open Source ##

Once a project is made public other developers in the public may want to make changes
to the repository. This can be done by forking a repository. Forking is a unique
way of making a copy of a personal repository and saving it on your GitHub. Sometimes forking
can be used as a way to take someone else's project and begin your own.

#### How it works: ####

1. First navigate to the public repository where contributions will be made to the code,
and click "Fork" in the upper right hand corner.
<p align="center">
  <img width="300" src="images/Bootcamp-Fork.png">
</p>
This repository will now be forked and a personal copy will be made to the users
personal GitHub account. This will be reflected in the repository title.
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/forked.png">
</p>

2. The repository will now need to be cloned locally, in order to make any changes
to the project.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/JustinsTeamMate/feature_branch_workflow.git
```

3. Edit, stage, and commit changes.
```
$ git status
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m "updated README.md"
```

4. Push changes to remote repository.
```
$ git push
```
After pushing to remote GitHub will show that the personal repository is ahead of
the original repository.
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ahead.png">
</p>

5. Click "Pull request" near the notification that this personal branch is ahead of
master. From here the process of contributing to a public repository is the same as
the section above on [pull requests](#pull-requests---multiple-developers). See above
for more detail.

## Fast-Forward ##

#### Feature Branches: ####

When merging a feature branch, by default git will try to merge a using **fast-forward** mode.
```
$ git merge feature-branch
```

When **fast-forward** is applied to a merge, git will merge the commits in a *linear*
fashion. When looking at the network diagram in the repository "Insights" the
history will look like the diagram on the right below.

To force git to merge with no fast forward use the parameter `--no-ff`:

```
$ git merge --no-ff feature-branch
```

With **no-fast-forward**, git will maintain the feature branch in the
history and create a new commit on `master` representing the merge with that
feature branch, as well as representing the commits from that branch separate from
`master`. This can be seen represented by the diagram on the left below.

<p align="center">
  <img width="500" src="images/ff-v-no-ff.png">
</p>

It is possible to configure git to automatically use `--no-ff` specifically for a
given branch.

```
$ git config branch.master.mergeoptions "--no-ff"
```

#### Pull Requests: ####

When working with pull requests on GitHub's web interface via the green
"Merge pull request" button, the default behavior is to use no fast-forward.

<p align="center">
  <img width="500" src="images/automerge.png">
</p>

GitHub behaves this way to ensure that pull requests can be identified later on.
However, it is possible to merge a pull request with fast forward for pull requests
with squashed or rebased commits.
