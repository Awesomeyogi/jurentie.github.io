My name is Justin Rentie. I was born in Palisade, Colorado where I lived for the first 17 years of my life. After high school I decided to pursue Computer Science at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado.

I graduated from C.S.U. in the spring 2018 semester with a degree in [Computer Science with a concentration in Human Centered Computing](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/cstop/csacademics/csdegrees/csbachelors/hccmajor.php).  

I am currently employed as a full time software developer at [Open Water Foundation](http://openwaterfoundation.org/) where I am primarily focused on java development for data processing tools as well as web development which includes creating online visualizations for collected water data.

Example visualizations:

I spent the past year focused primarily on web development. I developed skills in HTML/CSS as well as JavaScript and have learned a lot while working with the JavaScript library [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).

I'm currently focused on cultivating my skills as a back-end software developer using Java as well as Python. I have particular interest in the fields of algorithm's work, artificial intelligence, and blockchain/cryptocurrency. Currently I am focusing on better understanding blockchain and how it applies to crypto as well as other applications such as digital contracts.

It is my hope to soon make a move to Denver, Colorado where I can find solid work as a software developer and to develop further my skills as a programmer. With any luck I can get involved with algorithms, A.I., or crypto.
